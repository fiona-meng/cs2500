; == Lab 4, Problem 1 ==

; So maybe you've seen and/or played these games that
; follow a simple pattern: your character runs and
; jumps to gather coins/candy/etc (which equal points).
; So in this lab, you will build up to such a game
; while practicing designing union & self-referential
; data, as well as functions & programs that use it.

; We know this looks like a LONG program, but we've
; broken it up into small bits, so do your best and
; at least try every part - you can do this!!!

; A JumpLevel is one of:
; - "done"
; - (make-level Boolean JumpLevel)
; Interpretation: design of the correct actions
; in a jump game, either done or...
; - should-jump? is what the player should do
; - next is the next level of the game

; TODO #1: complete the data design recipe for the
; above data definition.

; TODO #2: design the function level-done?
; that accepts a JumpLevel and returns
; #true if the level done (and #false otherwise).
; (This is useful in making a game-end screen!)

; add-point that accepts a JumpLevel and
; a Boolean value representing whether the
; player opted to jump in the current level
; and returns 1 if the player should get a
; point for their (correct) action, 0 otherwise.
; So if the level is done, no points are awarded;
; otherwise, if the player action matches what
; they *should* have done, they get a point.

; "done".

; which produces the sequence of instructions to a
; player to get a perfect score in the game.
; An example set of instructions might be "run-jump-done".
; (This isn't useful in making the game, but it's

; a full game, since these will be useful later!).


; TODO #7: finish designing the draw-game function,
; which serves as the to-draw for big-bang.
; You should follow the template for Game, meaning
; that you'll need a helper to visualize the level
; (and then join that together somehow with the
; score you extract from the supplied game).
; You are welcome to be creative with how your game
; looks :)

; function, which serves as the on-key handler
; for big-bang. The idea here is that the player
; signifies they want to jump with the "j" key
; and run with the "r" key; your function
; should then produce the next state of the
; game, possibly updating the score and/or
; level.
;
; Hint: for a good design, let this function
; figure out which key was pressed and, if it
; was "j" or "r", call a helper with a Boolean
; indicating whether the player jumped; that
; function can then use the Game template to
; make a new game, while taking advantage of
; the add-point and progress-level helpers you
; designed in the beginning :)

; current game state

; TODO #9: finish designing the done-game?
; function, which serves as the stop-when
; handler in big-bang. The idea is just to
; return #true if the current level is "done".
; Your function should follow the Game
; template, which means calling a helper based
; on the JumpLevel template, which ... cough ...
; you may have already written above :)


; done-game? : Game -> Boolean

(check-expect (done-game? JumpLevel-0) #true)

; TODO #10: uncomment the function below and
; replace the ???'s with real BSL. The goal
; is that we initialize big-bang with a game
; that has zero score and the supplied level,
; and that when the game is done we are only
; returning the final score

; play : JumpLevel -> Nat
; plays the supplied levels and returns
; the final player score
