; == Homework 1, Problem 5 ==

; TODO: your task is to implement the function cycle-spelling
; so that when (animate cycle-spelling) is called,
; it animates spelling of the following defined long word,
; letter-by-letter (in all caps).
; When the end of the word is reached
; it cycles back and starts from the beginning.

(define LONG-WORD "floccinaucinihilipilification")

; Hint: one way to count 0 up to some number and then
; loop back is to think about dividing two numbers
; and taking the remainder; so the remainder of 1 / 5 is 1,
; the remainder of 4 / 5 is 4; and the remainder of 5 / 5
; is back to 0. In BSL, look at the remainder function.
(define background (square 300 "solid" "white"))
(define (cycle-spelling x)
  (overlay (text(substring LONG-WORD 0 (remainder x (string-length LONG-WORD))) 24 "olive")
           background))
