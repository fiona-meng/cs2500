; TODO #1: design the function alternate which, given two lists
; produces a list of alternating elements from each list (and if
; one list runs out of elements you should place all the remaining
; elements in the other list at the end). Some tests have been
; supplied for clarity.

; Restrictions:
; - Do NOT use ISL list abstractions.
