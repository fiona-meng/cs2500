; == Exam 2, Problem 1 ==

; TODO #1: design the function pair-then-smash that takes two lists (assumed to be the same
; length), performs one function on each pair from the two lists (the first from each list,
; then the second, ...), and then applies another function that takes the list of pairwise
; results and produces a final outcome.

; For example, consider the following parallel lists of strings and natural numbers...

(define L1 (list "a" "bb" "cccc"))
(define L2 (list 1 2 3))

; now consider the following function that determines if the length of a supplied string
; is equal to a supplied number...

(define (fp1 s n)
  (= (string-length s) n))

; applying this pairwise across L1 and L2 means (fp1 "a" 1), then (fp1 "bb" 2), ...
; and producing a result list...

(define PAIR-12 (list #true #true #false))

; so then consider the following function that asks if all the results are true...

(define (fs1 l)
  (andmap identity l))

; producing an overall answer (#false) that, in fact, one of the strings length is NOT
; equal to its corresponding number.

; For another example, consider the result of adding each pairwise element of L2
; with itself...

(define PAIR-22 (list 2 4 6))

; and then take the product of this resulting list...

(define (fs2 l)
  (foldr * 1 l))

; producing the answer of 48.
; For clarity, these examples have been supplied as the following tests;
; you can create additional tests but are not required to do so.

; pair-then-smash: [List-of X] [List-of Y] [X Y -> Z] [Z -> Z] -> Z
; compare the element in first list and the second list using the supplied function
; and then use another applies function to find the final outcome

(check-expect
 (pair-then-smash L1 L2 fp1 fs1)
 #false)

(check-expect
 (pair-then-smash L2 L2 + fs2)
 48)

; and for good measure...

(check-expect
 (pair-then-smash '() '() fp1 fs1)
 #true)

(check-expect
 (pair-then-smash '() '() + fs2)
 1)

; Note: you may choose to implement the function with list abstractions, template(s), or a
; combination; any well-designed design can receive full credit.


(define (pair-then-smash l1 l2 f1 f2)
  (local[; each?: (X Y Z) [List-of X] [List-of Y] [X Y -> Z] -> [List-of Z]
         ; compare the element in first list and the second list using
         ; the supplied function
         (define (each? l1 l2 f1)
           (cond
             [(and (empty? l1) (empty? l2)) '()]
             [(and (empty? l1) (cons? l2)) '()]
             [(and (empty? l1) (cons? l2)) '()]
             [(and (cons? l1) (cons? l2))
              (cons 
               (f1 (first l1) (first l2))
               (each? (rest l1) (rest l2) f1))]))]
    (f2 (each? l1 l2 f1))))


; TODO #2: using pair-then-smash, design the function palindrome? that accepts a list
; and determines if its elements are the same (via a supplied equality predicate) forward
; and backwards. Example tests have been included for clarity; you can create additional
; tests but are not required to do so. As with the previous problem, you are free to design
; your function (well) as you see fit as long as it is making effective use of the
; pair-then-smash abstraction.

; palindrome?: [List-of X] [X X-> Boolean] -> Boolean
; determine whether the list is same whether we read
; from forward or read from backward

 (palindrome? '() =)

  (Î» (s1 s2) (boolean=? (string=? s1 "w") (string=? s2 "w"))))
 #true)
